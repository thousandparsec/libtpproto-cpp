Massive changes in 0.1.0. Split into high level and low level interfaces.
Support for TP03. Still not thread safe, but should be easier to get there now.
No, I am not playing catchup with the version number.  There was a big improvement
over the 0.0.x series.

No code changes in 0.0.3.  Just doxygen documentation for all classes in the 
library.  Should be binary identical except for one byte (last part of the 
version number.)
It was quite an effect, so I hope it is appreciated.

No real changes in 0.0.2 other than removing most (if not all of the current) memory
leaks in the library.  Documentation is still coming  :-)

I'm releasing 0.0.1 so that people can start working on clients using the library.
There are two big problems:
1) it's not thread safe (could be a problem in graphical environments)
2) there is no documentation
I will work on these in the next release.  Probably documentation first.  The thread-safe issue
is not easy to solve and might mean a complete rewrite, so it might not happen for a while.
Let me know if you're using this library.  Any feedback is helpful.
