I'm releasing 0.0.1 so that people can start working on clients using the library.
There are two big problems:
1) it's not thread safe (could be a problem in graphical environments)
2) there is no documentation
I will work on these in the next release.  Probably documentation first.  The thread-safe issue
is not easy to solve and might mean a complete rewrite, so it might not happen for a while.
Let me know if you're using this library.  Any feedback is helpful.
